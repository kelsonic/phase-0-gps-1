**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
Prior to the GPS session, I was quite confused at the concepts of pull requests and the git add . command and what exactly a commit is.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
During my GPS session, the concepts of the git add . command and commits were clarified by our guide. After discussing it with my pair for a bit about what we thought the command and what commits were, our guide clarified for us the actual definition.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
For my pair, I first asked about how he was doing (as per the video suggestion), then throughout the guided pairing session, all my questions were mainly clarifications for the holes in my understanding.

**What still confuses you about git?**
The biggest confusion my pair and I still have about git is what exactly a pull-request is. As my pair said during our session, it would make a lot more sense if a pull request was called a push request, because you're pushing the file onto Github.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
I very much enjoyed my first session! The only quip I have about this entire process is the Phase0 website - while the timing said 1:00AM CST for my GPS 1.1, the timing of the GPS was actually 1:00AM GMT +8, or my local time in Beijing. Overall the pairing session in this GPS was quite enjoyable, and going through the step-by-step process of all this really helped me understand using git better.
