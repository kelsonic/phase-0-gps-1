#GPS 1.1 Reflection Questions
**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

Prior to the GPS session, my teammate and I were a bit confused about pull requests. It seemed to us a bit odd that it is called a pull request instead of a push request. We were also a bit confused about the git flow process and when your changes are actually pushed to the GitHub servers.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Our guide clarified to us what was actually happening under the hood with the git add and git commit commands.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

At first we asked one another how we were doing and a little bit of background to get to know one another. My teammate and I, as mentioned above, asked each other about the naming of pull requests. 

**What still confuses you about git?**

I am still a bit confused why it is called a pull request instead of a push request since you are pushing (and merging) the branch to GitHub.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It was great! My teammate was outgoing, a quick learner, and very friendly, which made the experience much more fun!
